This is a repository containing my Master thesis work!

In the file ns_ale_elastic3.py you can find the most updated formulation: NS, ALE, Nitsche method to impose bc and rectangular mesh.s

The current manufactured solution test case is:
src/test_cases_nitsche/ns_ale_nitsche/ns_ale_mms_CN.py

The current realistic simulation is:
src/elastic/models/model0_new.py
